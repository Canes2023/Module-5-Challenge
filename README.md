# Work-Day-Scheduler

For this challenge, I was tasked to fix the work day scheduler. Before I fixed it, the save button wouldn't work so nothing would get saved to local storage and there was only 9am to 12pm. There is supposed to be 9am to 5pm. I added the extra time blocks and color coded each text box because before, the boxes were all grey. Now each box is either green indicating a new event, grey a past event, or orange a current event. When you type something into each text box, you can click the save button and a message below the day and month will appear saying "appointment has been added to local storage" with a green chechmark. You can open the dev tools, click on application, and see the local storage. Inside you will see your message and the hour it was saved on. It's easy to read and understand.
